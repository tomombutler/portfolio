We left the busy South East of England and took on the challenge of this 3 acre smallholding in the Wild West of Wales in January 2016. We had been looking for a while for a place to give us space to try out our ideas and the land to give us the opportunity to pool our skills, knowledge and backgrounds and to try to create a life for our family that embraced the essence of nature, farming and self-sufficiency.
